# Forklift_Odometry

# Overview
The Forklift Odometry Project aims to develop a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for estimating the odometry of a forklift robot. This package utilizes CAN bus data which includes: the wheel travel and the steering angle with the robot's kinematic model to calculate and publish the robot's pose and velocity information.
